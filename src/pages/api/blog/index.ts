      <h2>Essential Air Cooler Maintenance Tips for Summer</h2>
      
      <p>As summer approaches, your air cooler becomes an essential appliance for maintaining comfort in your home. Regular maintenance not only ensures optimal cooling performance but also extends the lifespan of your cooler. Here are some essential maintenance tips to keep your air cooler running efficiently throughout the summer:</p>
      
      <h3>1. Clean or Replace Filters Regularly</h3>
      <p>Dirty filters restrict airflow and reduce cooling efficiency. Clean the filters at least once a month during heavy usage periods. If your cooler has replaceable filters, consider changing them at the beginning of each summer season.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Check Water Tank and Prevent Leakage</h3>
      <p>Inspect the water tank for any cracks or damage. Clean it thoroughly to remove mineral deposits and prevent algae growth. If you notice any leakage, check the water distribution system and ensure all connections are secure.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Clean Cooling Pads</h3>
      <p>The cooling pads are crucial for effective cooling. Remove them carefully and rinse with clean water to remove dust and mineral deposits. If they appear damaged or worn out, replace them immediately for optimal cooling.</p>
      
      <h3>4. Lubricate Moving Parts</h3>
      <p>Apply a few drops of lubricating oil to the motor and fan bearings to ensure smooth operation. This reduces friction and prevents overheating of the motor.</p>
      
      <h3>5. Check Electrical Connections</h3>
      <p>Inspect all electrical connections for any signs of damage or wear. Ensure the power cord is in good condition and there are no exposed wires.</p>
      
      <h3>6. Clean the Exterior</h3>
      <p>Wipe down the exterior of the cooler with a damp cloth to remove dust and dirt. This not only improves the appearance but also prevents dust from being circulated in your home.</p>
      
      <h3>7. Prepare for Storage</h3>
      <p>At the end of summer, drain all water from the tank and dry the cooler thoroughly before storing it. Cover it with a dust cover to protect it during the off-season.</p>
      
      <p>By following these simple maintenance tips, you can ensure your air cooler provides efficient cooling throughout the summer months. If you encounter any issues that you cannot resolve, don't hesitate to contact Servsy for professional assistance.</p>

      <h2>LED TV Buying Guide: What to Look for in 2025</h2>
      
      <p>With technology evolving rapidly and numerous options available in the market, choosing the right LED TV can be overwhelming. This comprehensive guide will help you navigate through the key factors to consider when purchasing an LED TV in 2025.</p>
      
      <h3>1. Resolution</h3>
      <p>Resolution refers to the number of pixels that make up the display:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels)</strong>: Good for smaller screens and budget options</li>
        <li><strong>4K Ultra HD (3840 x 2160 pixels)</strong>: Offers four times the resolution of Full HD, ideal for screens 43 inches and larger</li>
        <li><strong>8K (7680 x 4320 pixels)</strong>: The highest resolution available, best for very large screens (65+ inches)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>2. Panel Types</h3>
      <p>Different panel technologies offer varying picture quality and viewing experiences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>LED-LCD</strong>: Most common and affordable option</li>
        <li><strong>QLED</strong>: Offers better brightness and color accuracy than standard LED</li>
        <li><strong>OLED</strong>: Provides perfect blacks, infinite contrast, and wide viewing angles</li>
        <li><strong>Mini-LED</strong>: Improved local dimming for better contrast than standard LED</li>
        <li><strong>Micro-LED</strong>: Emerging technology combining OLED's contrast with LED's brightness</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>3. Smart Features</h3>
      <p>Most modern TVs come with smart features, but they vary in functionality:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Operating system (Android TV, webOS, Tizen, etc.)</li>
        <li>Voice control capabilities</li>
        <li>App availability and support</li>
        <li>Integration with smart home devices</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>4. Refresh Rate</h3>
      <p>Higher refresh rates result in smoother motion, especially important for gaming and sports:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>60Hz</strong>: Standard refresh rate, adequate for most content</li>
        <li><strong>120Hz</strong>: Better for fast-moving content like sports and action movies</li>
        <li><strong>Variable refresh rate (VRR)</strong>: Essential for gaming to prevent screen tearing</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>5. HDR (High Dynamic Range)</h3>
      <p>HDR enhances contrast and color range for more realistic images:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>HDR10</strong>: Basic HDR format supported by most content</li>
        <li><strong>Dolby Vision</strong>: Dynamic HDR format that adjusts settings scene by scene</li>
        <li><strong>HDR10+</strong>: Samsung's dynamic HDR format, similar to Dolby Vision</li>
        <li><strong>HLG</strong>: Designed for broadcast television</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>6. Connectivity</h3>
      <p>Ensure your TV has the right ports for your devices:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>HDMI 2.1</strong>: Required for 4K/120Hz gaming and 8K content</li>
        <li><strong>USB ports</strong>: For connecting external drives or powering streaming devices</li>
        <li><strong>Optical audio output</strong>: For connecting to sound systems</li>
        <li><strong>Ethernet port</strong>: For stable internet connection</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>7. Sound Quality</h3>
      <p>While most TVs have decent built-in speakers, consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Output power (measured in watts)</li>
        <li>Support for Dolby Atmos or DTS:X</li>
        <li>Compatibility with external sound systems</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>8. Size and Viewing Distance</h3>
      <p>Choose a TV size based on your viewing distance:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For 4K TVs: Viewing distance (in inches) รท 1.5 = recommended screen size</li>
        <li>For 1080p TVs: Viewing distance (in inches) รท 2.5 = recommended screen size</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>By considering these factors, you can make an informed decision when purchasing your next LED TV. Remember that the best TV for you depends on your specific needs, viewing habits, and budget. If you need assistance with installation or setup after purchase, Servsy offers professional LED TV installation services across India.</p>

        <li><strong>Clogged drain pipe</strong>: Check and clear any blockages in your home's drain pipe</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>6. Washing Machine Stops Mid-Cycle</h3>

      </ul>
      
      <h3>When to Call a Professional</h3>
      <p>While many issues can be resolved with DIY solutions, some problems require professional attention:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Electrical issues (burning smell, sparks, or shocks)</li>
        <li>Major water leaks that persist after checking hoses and connections</li>
